## Introduction

The data for this project comes from the Lahman baseball database.  The data is a joined hitting and salary dataset that has basic statitistics (hits, walks, homeruns etc.) and the player's salary in dollars.

The goal of this project is to determine what metrics Major League Baseball teams value the most.  Major league players want to know what metrics they can improve in order to get a more valuable contract.  By the conclusion of the analysis, a model will be chosen and analyzed for feature importance using shap values.  The shap values will then be used to make recommendations for players.
